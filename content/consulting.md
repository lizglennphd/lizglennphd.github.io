      title: Specialties
      text: My main programming language is R as it is open source which supports reproducability, a part of the open science movement. R also allows me to create pipelines from data cleaning to data analysis to re-run analyses in an efficient, seamless, and reproducible manner. <p> I am also familiar with other statistical software such as SPSS, SAS, and Mplus. </p>

      title: Advanced Statistical Analyses
      text: Statistical Techniques include - 
      - Structural Equation Modelling: How do these variables influence each other? In these models, we can also use latent variable modelling to increase precision of our findings. This includes mediation and moderation models.  
      - Latent Variable Modelling (Confirmatory Factor Analysis): How do individual data sources represent or measure larger theoretical concepts (latent variables)?
      - Latent Growth Curve Modelling: Are there changes in these variables over time? Do certain variables or interventions impact change?
      - Latent Profile Analysis: Within this population, are there distinct groups based on certain characteristics (variables)?

## Specialties

### Advanced Statistical Analyses

**Other specialties:**

- Reliability Statistics (Kappa, ICC, Chronbach's alpha)
- Meta-Analysis (homogeneity, bias)

### Data Science

I use the tidyverse suite in R to make the best use of existing data.

- Data Visualization: Bringing data to life using graphics. There are many pre-exisiting packages built in R that maximize visual insights specific to the data type or analysis. I can adjust color schemes and font to match your institution or business branding.
- Webscraping: Extracting data from online sources into a spreadsheet that can be used for decision making, data visualizations, or data analyses.
- Text-Based Data: Turning qualitative data into a quantitative format. Qualitative data is usually from interview transcripts or free response items.
- Data Cleaning and Creation: Turning raw data into variables that are useful in analyses.
- Data Missingness: There are many approaches to data missingness, which is often dependent on your data and analytic plan. I am familiar with a range of imputation methods to help create full datasets when needed, or the use of analytic approaches that account for missingness (FIML).

## Fees

- Hourly Rate = $75/hr
- Discounted price available for graduate students and early career researchers ($50/hr).
- Data Analysis projects resulting in a full manuscript usually take around 20 hours.
- Once a manuscript is submitted, I will not charge for minor edits during the revision process.
- I can accept checks or online payment (3% processing fee).
