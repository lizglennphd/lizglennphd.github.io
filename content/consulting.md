      ## Statistical Analyses
        My main programming language is R. R is open source which supports reproducability, a part of the open science movement. R also allows me to create pipelines from data cleaning to data analysis to re-run analyses in an efficient, seamless, and reproducible manner. I am also familiar with other statistical software such as SPSS, SAS, and Mplus.
      
      - Structural Equation Modelling: How do these variables influence each other? In these models, we can also use latent variable modelling to increase precision of our findings. This includes mediation and moderation models.
      - Latent Variable Modelling (Confirmatory Factor Analysis): How do individual data sources represent or measure larger theoretical concepts (latent variables)?
      - Latent Growth Curve Modelling: Are there changes in these variables over time? Do certain variables or interventions impact change?
      - Latent Profile Analysis: Within this population, are there distinct groups based on certain characteristics (variables)?
