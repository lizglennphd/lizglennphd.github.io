        ### Advanced Statistical Analyses
            My main programming language is R as it is open source which supports reproducability, a part of the open science movement. R also allows me to create pipelines from data cleaning to data analysis to re-run analyses in an efficient, seamless, and reproducible manner. I am also familiar with other statistical software such as SPSS, SAS, and Mplus.
