    summary: |
      I completed my PhD in School Psychology at the University of Oregon (APA-accredited). My graduate advisors were Dr. Laura Lee McIntyre and Dr. Nicole Guiliani. My dissertation focused on how parent-child emotion regulation processes dictate parent and child mental health in preschoolers with developmental delays. Clinical training included providing comprehensive assessments across school and clinic settings, and providing evidence-based therapy in a range of settings (clinics, community programs, telehealth, schools) and populations (foster parents, neurodivergent individuals, LGBTQ+ teens).
